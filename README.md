## Description
This repository contains a simple UNIX command interpreter written as part of the ALX School curriculum. The program replicates functionalities of the simple shell (sh). Functions include reading, parsing, executing commands, and handling environment variables.

## Installation

git clone https://github.com/Ma7moudMSA/simple_shell.git
```

## Compilation

```bash
gcc -Wall -Werror -Wextra -pedantic *.c -o hsh
```

## Usage
After compilation, the shell can be run with:

```bash
./hsh
```

## Features
